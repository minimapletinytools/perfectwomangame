::Unity questions::
-confirm if pressing button in middle is the same as suspend and if there is any easy way to handle this

::USER LOGIN PLAN::
-game start
-if user is logged in, proceed with current user
-if there is no user logged in
	-prompty user to log in?
	-proceed as guest user??
-load save data from user
	-generate menus, and game state, etc
	-do not start game until character is loaded
	-if error (as in, save exists but it's corrupted or something)
		-prompt user that there was an error, but offer them to keep playing I guess?
		-start a new game with a new save
		-try and read the save again at end of game rather than overwriting it right away...
			-or not, spelunky screwed me over like that :\
-play game
-on user change/logout event
	-pause game
	-prompt user to sign back in and resume the game
	-or allow them to sign out and restart the game
-on suspend event
	-pause the game
		-do I need to save the game state? This could be as easy as saving the current character your at I guess
		-that would allow for cheating though (i.e. infinite retries)
-on resume event
	-if user is the same, continue the game
	-if not, proceed as in OnUserChange/logout event
-game finished (last character played)
	-try and save the game under the current user
	-if error??? whatever
	-update leaderboards with current character


::ADDITIONAL FEATURES NEEDED::
-stats 
	-waiting on unity for this
-rich presence string
	-I believe I can do this with the RTA plugin but maybe not and it may not be finished either
-achievement notification
	-do those annoying popups happen automatically? If not, then I'll have to do it myself.
-leaderboards
	-ugg, maybe not


::UNITY XB1 API NOTES::

-add a suspnend event
	-XboxOnePLM.OnSuspendingEvent                  += Suspending;
	-.... XboxOnePLM.AmReadyToSuspendNow();
	-this should do a panic save within 1 second ( or not save at all )
-resource availability changed
	-when does this get called??
	-XboxOnePLM.OnResourceAvailabilityChangedEvent += ResourceAvailabilityChangedEvent;
	-mute audio. Maybe this happens when you shrink the screen.
	-could also pause
	-this will tell me which mode I am in now
-resuming
	- XboxOnePLM.OnResumingEvent                    += Resuming;
	-do we need to do anything here?
	-need to check if user has changed
-activation
	- XboxOnePLM.OnActivationEvent                  += Activation;
	-void Activation(ActivatedEventArgs args)
	-check PreviousExecutionState if we should attemp to reload our panic save
		-if (XboxOneApplicationExecutionState.Terminated == XboxOnePLM.GetPreviousExecutionState()) 
		-you could also do this in the Start() routine or whenever. Probably better not to do it in theh callback b/c you don't know when it will get called.
	-args.Kind == Portocol or Launch. Do not know what this means
		-it means whether it was launched from a protocol or regularly, don't need to worry about this
	-apparently I'm suppose to respond to this to get out of constrained mode
-view states
	-full
	-fill  (htis is the window in the menu)
	-not visible
	-is there a callback for this???
-storage
	-connected storage
		-for save data that's meant to go between consolse
		-apps can quickly save 16mb that goes into a buffer
		-automatic handling fo crashes and stuff etc...
		-there is USER storage and MACHINE storage
			-machine storage can be accessed by anyone, even if there is no user signed in
		-you can delete storage via
			-xbstorage reset /force
	-XB live title storage
		-???
	-Local Temporary Storage
		-contents may be evicted when app is not running
		-do NOT use for game saves (obviosuly)
	-presistent local storage
		-use it for resume events I guess, or can you get away with using local temp storage or connected storage?
		-do NOT use for game saves
		-used for stuff like video recordings and other unimportant stuff.


::API NOTES::
-UserPlugin has three functions to get user info
	-UserManager
		-Create()/Destroy()/Inst (singleton)
		-Events (set of active user changes, newusersignsin, soemtign about user changed, signin complete (when the dialog closes), signout started (save the game))
		-sign out started
			-create signoutdeferral and then complete to establish enough time to save the game using connected storage
		-request sign in
			-probably don't need
		-issomeone signed in
			-if not, either start in no user mode, or requst someone sign in
	-User
		-acess from UsersManager
		-can check the IsSignedIn property
		-how do I tell if this is the main user???
		-I guess just take index 0
		-be sure to manually refresh???
-DataPlatform just has initialization functions
	-pretty sure this is read only stuff and we don't need it, SCID will take care of it, we just need to update stats
	-initialization is asynch so make sure you wait for it
-StatsisticsPlugin/StatisticsManager
	-Statistics.Create() (one frame delay for plugins to pass interfaces to each other)
	-GetSingleUserStatisticsAsync
	-what are multiple stats?
	-how do I set stats??
-Storage Plugin
	-ConnectedStorage (online storage)	
		-should use for game saves
	-TtileStorage  (offline storage? more flexible)
	-StorageManager::Create() (allows storage manager to find User Plugin)
	-ConnectedStorage::CreateAsync(callback)
	-Connected Storage
		-CreateAsync
		-OpenOrCreateContainer
		-ContainerContextPlugin
			-GetASync, returns IMapView with immutable keys 
				-need to convert DataMapView into a DataMap to edit??
			-ReadAsync????
			-SubmitUpdatesAsync
				-pass in an updated DataMap
		-DataMapView
			-convert to Data Map using CreateFromDataMapView
			-Add/UpdateBuffer functions...

::SCID notes::
-see https://developer.xboxlive.com/en-us/platform/development/documentation/xdp/Pages/IntroducingTheServiceConfig_xdpdocs.aspx
-Events, these are things that happen during a game
	-how to generate an event?
	-examples	
		-started the game
		-finished ____ character
		-beat the game
-Stats, these are stats related to the game, e.g. number of zombies killed
	-how to update stats?
	-there are single stat instances, an a 'stat template' but I think we will only use single stat instances
	-examples	
		-number of characters played
			-number of unique characters played
		-number of games beaten
		-number of deaths
-Hero Stats, need 3-10, these are 'most representative' stats
	-how to set these stats
		-I imagine it's something I do in the SCID workbook and not via code
-Real-Time Activities (just means updating stats in real time???)
-Achievements, a collection of specific stat instances where once they reach a threshold result in a reward
	-defined using a set of rules
	-rewards
		-artwork?? (can be downloaded??)
		-gamerscore increase (easy)
		-in-app rewards
	-can hide or show achievements in the achievement list
	-how to create achievements
		-again, I imagine this is something done in the SCID workbook
		-which also means that I don't need to mess around with the achievement API assuming I I don't need something like an in game achievement list.
-Challenges, achievements availble only during a specific time frame
	-lets not do challenges
-Leaderboards, xblive high score service. 
	-is this available to non-live subscribers? probably
	-do we want a leader board
	-how to make a leaderboard???
-Multiplayer Session templates
	-NA
-Matchmaking Hoppers
	-NA
-Rich Present Strings, a string describing what the player is doing
	-how to set?

		-"floating in space as a 110 year old astronaut"
		-"out in the antartic as a whale hunter"
		-"reminiscing on my life"
-Game DVR strings
	-NA
Localized Strings
	-provide all localization of strings in the SCID here
-Sets, allows dynamically updated rich presence strings based on stats.
	-NA
-Storage, cloud storgae, can be global or segregated (by user, session or device)
	-local user storage is probably fine but cloud storage would also be cool
	-binary, json and config format all ok.
		-obv. binary, then I can just use C# serialization
-Network security authorization list
	-NA
-Access Policies ????
	-???






::ZIG STRUCTURE NOTES::
-put both Zig_UpdateUser and Zig_Update (ZigInput callback) inside of ZigManager
-abstract away DepthImage/PixelImage/UserImage into their own classes
-AlternativeDepthViewer should just produce a texture and pass it to the game to render (rather then render itself in the GUI routine)
-both AlternativeDepthViewer/ImageViewer should be ZigFu specific, and instead, interface through ZigManager to pass their updated textures to the game
