::ZIG STRUCTURE NOTES::
-put both Zig_UpdateUser and Zig_Update (ZigInput callback) inside of ZigManager
-abstract away DepthImage/PixelImage/UserImage into their own classes
-AlternativeDepthViewer should just produce a texture and pass it to the game to render (rather then render itself in the GUI routine)
-both AlternativeDepthViewer/ImageViewer should be ZigFu specific, and instead, interface through ZigManager to pass their updated textures to the game
