::Unity questions::
-confirm if pressing button in middle is the same as suspend and if there is any easy way to handle this


::USER LOGIN PLAN::
-game start
-if user is logged in, proceed with current user
-if there is no user logged in
	-prompty user to log in?
	-proceed as guest user??
-load save data from user
	-generate menus, and game state, etc
	-do not start game until character is loaded
	-if error (as in, save exists but it's corrupted or something)
		-prompt user that there was an error, but offer them to keep playing I guess?
		-start a new game with a new save
		-try and read the save again at end of game rather than overwriting it right away...
			-or not, spelunky screwed me over like that :\
-play game
-on user change/logout event
	-pause game
	-prompt user to sign back in and resume the game
	-or allow them to sign out and restart the game
-on suspend event
	-pause the game
		-do I need to save the game state? This could be as easy as saving the current character your at I guess
		-that would allow for cheating though (i.e. infinite retries)
-on resume event
	-if user is the same, continue the game
	-if not, proceed as in OnUserChange/logout event
-game finished (last character played)
	-try and save the game under the current user
	-if error??? whatever
	-update leaderboards with current character


::ADDITIONAL FEATURES NEEDED::
-stats 
	-waiting on unity for this
-rich presence string
	-I believe I can do this with the RTA plugin but maybe not and it may not be finished either
-achievement notification
	-do those annoying popups happen automatically? If not, then I'll have to do it myself.
-leaderboards
	-ugg, maybe not


::API NOTES::
-UserPlugin has three functions to get user info
	-UserManager
		-Create()/Destroy()/Inst (singleton)
		-Events (set of active user changes, newusersignsin, soemtign about user changed, signin complete (when the dialog closes), signout started (save the game))
		-sign out started
			-create signoutdeferral and then complete to establish enough time to save the game using connected storage
		-request sign in
			-probably don't need
		-issomeone signed in
			-if not, either start in no user mode, or requst someone sign in
	-User
		-acess from UsersManager
		-can check the IsSignedIn property
		-how do I tell if this is the main user???
		-I guess just take index 0
		-be sure to manually refresh???
-DataPlatform just has initialization functions
	-pretty sure this is read only stuff and we don't need it, SCID will take care of it, we just need to update stats
	-initialization is asynch so make sure you wait for it
-StatsisticsPlugin/StatisticsManager
	-Statistics.Create() (one frame delay for plugins to pass interfaces to each other)
	-GetSingleUserStatisticsAsync
	-what are multiple stats?
	-how do I set stats??
-Storage Plugin
	-ConnectedStorage (online storage)	
		-should use for game saves
	-TtileStorage  (offline storage? more flexible)
	-StorageManager::Create() (allows storage manager to find User Plugin)
	-ConnectedStorage::CreateAsync(callback)
	-Connected Storage
		-CreateAsync
		-OpenOrCreateContainer
		-ContainerContextPlugin
			-GetASync, returns IMapView with immutable keys 
				-need to convert DataMapView into a DataMap to edit??
			-ReadAsync????
			-SubmitUpdatesAsync
				-pass in an updated DataMap
		-DataMapView
			-convert to Data Map using CreateFromDataMapView
			-Add/UpdateBuffer functions...

::SCID notes::
-see https://developer.xboxlive.com/en-us/platform/development/documentation/xdp/Pages/IntroducingTheServiceConfig_xdpdocs.aspx
-Events, these are things that happen during a game
	-how to generate an event?
	-examples	
		-started the game
		-finished ____ character
		-beat the game
-Stats, these are stats related to the game, e.g. number of zombies killed
	-how to update stats?
	-there are single stat instances, an a 'stat template' but I think we will only use single stat instances
	-examples	
		-number of characters played
			-number of unique characters played
		-number of games beaten
		-number of deaths
-Hero Stats, need 3-10, these are 'most representative' stats
	-how to set these stats
		-I imagine it's something I do in the SCID workbook and not via code
-Real-Time Activities (just means updating stats in real time???)
-Achievements, a collection of specific stat instances where once they reach a threshold result in a reward
	-defined using a set of rules
	-rewards
		-artwork?? (can be downloaded??)
		-gamerscore increase (easy)
		-in-app rewards
	-can hide or show achievements in the achievement list
	-how to create achievements
		-again, I imagine this is something done in the SCID workbook
		-which also means that I don't need to mess around with the achievement API assuming I I don't need something like an in game achievement list.
-Challenges, achievements availble only during a specific time frame
	-lets not do challenges
-Leaderboards, xblive high score service. 
	-is this available to non-live subscribers? probably
	-do we want a leader board
	-how to make a leaderboard???
-Multiplayer Session templates
	-NA
-Matchmaking Hoppers
	-NA
-Rich Present Strings, a string describing what the player is doing
	-how to set?
	-examples
		-"floating in space as a 110 year old astronaut"
		-"out in the antartic as a whale hunter"
		-"reminiscing on my life"
-Game DVR strings
	-NA
Localized Strings
	-provide all localization of strings in the SCID here
-Sets, allows dynamically updated rich presence strings based on stats.
	-NA
-Storage, cloud storgae, can be global or segregated (by user, session or device)
	-local user storage is probably fine but cloud storage would also be cool
	-binary, json and config format all ok.
		-obv. binary, then I can just use C# serialization
-Network security authorization list
	-NA
-Access Policies ????
	-???






::ZIG STRUCTURE NOTES::
-put both Zig_UpdateUser and Zig_Update (ZigInput callback) inside of ZigManager
-abstract away DepthImage/PixelImage/UserImage into their own classes
-AlternativeDepthViewer should just produce a texture and pass it to the game to render (rather then render itself in the GUI routine)
-both AlternativeDepthViewer/ImageViewer should be ZigFu specific, and instead, interface through ZigManager to pass their updated textures to the game

::NEW PLAY NOTES::
-easy
	-arms only
	-only one limb changes at once. Note we're talking about absolute changes

::XB1 REQUIREMENTS::
-run the submission validator makepkg /L or /LT
-must respond to suspend event and return within 1 second 
	-Does unity take care of this??
	-this happens when user switches titles. Is this not the same as quitting?
	-if not... 
	-ok.. need to register XboxOnePLM.OnSuspendingEvent and save current game state data
		-need to call  XboxOnePLM.AmReadyToSuspendNow() within .9 seconds
		-I guess you can have title screen go straight into last character??
		-check XboxOnePLM.AmResumingFromTerminatedState() to see if resuming
-virtual keyboard needs to support smartglass as well 
	-may need this eventually for social network connection etc... but not now
-all xb1 brand assets need to fit https://developer.xboxlive.com/en-us/platform/publishing/Pages/Xbox_One_Brand_Assets.aspx
-you'll need to get a game rating (ESRB??)
-menu accesible via menu button
	-(restart game, reset game, challenge mode, etc)
	-does this mean I need to pause the game??? crap

-xbox help function???? 
	-basic game info, contact info
-if sharing kinect related stuff, must provide preview of what is being shared
	-can't share expression/face tracking info for whatever reason
-The title performs a language/locale check to determine whether the current setting matches the speech.
	-Every title must match its acoustic model to the userâ€™s console locale. Titles must gracefully handle. scenarios where the title does not support all of the locales and languages that are supported on the console.
-Titles must adhere to the events raised by Xbox One global speech commands if their title supports the functions associated with those commands. specifically Xbox Show Menu/Change View/Pause/Play/Go Back
-must not use Windows::Xbox::Input::InputManager::DeferSystemGestures() during menus
-title must support streaming install with initial chunk no bigger than 3gb (not a prob) (but we could stream the unused character bundles..)
-must be able to install DLC without restatring game
-active user nonsense
	-can I just have it based on system not user?
		-don't hink so. connected storage autamitaclly assosciates with a user
	-suppose to recognize when controller is disconnected but do I really need this?
	-LOOK MORE INTO THIS ONE...
-should probably pause the game if user walks off screen lol...
-achievements
