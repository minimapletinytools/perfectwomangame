This is the source code for the critically acclaimed XB1 game [Perfect Woman](http://www.perfectwomangame.com/)

To run this, you'll need to copy over generated asset bundles from the [perfectwomanfiles](https://github.com/pdlla/perfectwomanfiles) repo into the Resources directory.

This still uses the now defunct ZigFu library for PC/MAC builds. It will probably only work on older versions of Windows and Mac. You'll also need to install the ZigFu drivers. Goodluck with all that. There are keyboard shortcuts however so it's not required to run the game.
