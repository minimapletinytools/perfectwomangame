::BUSINESS PLAN FOR SUPER SWEET GERMAN GAME CONTEST::
Perfect Woman is a Kinect game currently being built for PC and MAC. With the Kinect 2.0 built into the new Xbox One, we aim to have our game published on this next gen platform before the end of 2014. This is all made possible with the new Xbox ID program and their partnership with Unity to allow independent developers like us publish or games with low financial overhead on their console using Unity3d. We have a strong presence in the indy games community and hope to use this to launch ourselves into mainstream awareness. While our game may present a critical view of woman in society, it does so from approachable and ultimately fun perspective. We've had hundreds of players, the majority of which non gamers, play Perfect Woman at various publish festivals that we have shown at. The feedback from our playtester and press has been overwhelmingly positive. We see Perfect Woman as a game that is incredibly approachable from a wide audience both in content and gameplay. Finally, we plan on releasing the game to a much broader audience by launching a keyboard compatible version shortly after the Xbox One launch. Steam has proven to be a major milestone for independent developers. The content on steam is all of superb quality with Steam's greenlight curation process. As IGF finalists, we are already approved to publish Perfect Woman on Steam.

::TODO list for LEA::
-missing
	-34-3 CUTSCENE0_1
-05-2, 27-4 icons are too red
-change one of the team names in the pro gamer to "Scarlet Queens" pretty please :)
-use "poor" instead of mediocre maybe

DONE-need a grave dot in sunset for positioning the grave..
DONE-name label needs to be even longer 
DONE-sunset score label needs to be a littel large
DONE-reorder 85 cutscenes one more time! (sorry, I think we had miscommunication on how this should be done)
	-cutscene 4 should be early death (gruesome death)
	-cutscene 0 is good natural death (i.e. made it to end of stage)
	-cutscene 1 is bad natural death
DONE-whale position appears to be off
DONE-Cashier's flashlight is not transparent!!!!
DONE-what do you mean name of the pose (e.g. belly dance teacher) can still be seen in selection screen????
	-I wont be implementing the new choosing screen anytime soon, is this related to the new choosing screen?
DONE-sunset dot colors
	-change dot for grave to 255,0,0,45
	-add a dot for age 110, it should be 255,0,0,40 I need this for positioning the grave 
	-add a dummy character for age 110 and call it SUNSET_110.png. If you are lazy you can just copy paste one of the other characters ;).
DONE-sunset dots (two options) (pick one. I vote for option 1 :D)
	-option 1
		-distance from ground to dot position should be about the same for each characters
		-distance between each dot should be about the same
		-problem with this is the centers of characters may be off and the rotation jiggle wont look right
			-actually this is kind of a problem regardless because you have characters like the whale which probably wont be exactly centered the same way the other characters are..
			-could solve this problem by using a position jiggle
	-option 2
		-dots stay the same
		-I use formula to determine where the characters approximately are and use that to place score labels
		-problem with this is the labels may not line up nicely with the characters...
DONE-age 45 sunset dot in wrong position or maybe it's not reading it properly?
DONEish...-baby name label has ugly croppynig what to do?
	-OK special label sounds good
	-special label for age 110 as well
DONE-matriarch not centered about the fireplace
	-I actualyl think it's okay if some characters are very off centered. e.g. mourning lady should be off to the side. I think it adds interesting variation
NOPE-head should go in front of hands
-because you were as tudent, becoming a prof was hard for you???

::INSTALLATION::
Kinect
at least 10 feet of space
Big screen (TV or projector) so you can read smaller text when standing 10 feet away from screen

Play game:
-Install Zigfu plugin: zigfu.com
-If on Windows and using Kinect for Windows (as oppose to the xbox 360 one) please install Kinect for Windows runtime drivers: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36997
-Plug in Kinect
-Open Perfect PERFECTWOMAN_IGF_MAC_10-15 (mac) or PERFECTWOMAN_IGF_WIN_10-15 > PW.exe (win)

::PWGAME DSECRIPTION::
Perfect Woman is game inspired by the ubiquitous personality questionnaires featured in women’s magazines and the female roles they define. There are so many such roles emphasizing aspects of family, career, experience, sex and more. But these can not possibly characterize the depth and complexity of a woman's life. Perfect Woman uses these stereotypes as building blocks for you to be your OWN perfect woman.

The game is structured into progressive levels, each one representing a different stage in a woman's life. Starting at the child stage, players must post in front of a Kinect to mimic various poses that appear on screen. The better a player is able to hold the pose, the more "perfect" their rating for that level.

Perfect Woman features a branching decision tree which serves to create a narrative of the character's life. Past choices may make future choices more difficult. It's not always possible to be perfect at every stage in life, and that's perfectly finxqe.

-unlock structure
	-when choosing, see which characters are unlocked and only allow choosing for those characters...
	-choosing should support N characters evenly spaced out...
		-or maybe it's better to retain spacing and do balkced out boxes for unavail characters.


::CONVERTING TO MONOGAME::
-figure out if it's reasonable to expect monogame support on xbox one
-redo input capturing functions
-rendering
	-rewrite flat image class nonsense
	-redo camera components
		-viewports
	-rewrite shaders
-rewrite zigfu nonsense (you'd have to do this anyways)
-asset bundle redo
	-rewrite asset bundle loading functions.
	-index file generator (equivalent to asset bundle except in text file format)
-performance graph rendering probably needs to be redone

::IDEAS::
-actress, cosplayer, scientist/engineer, athlete
-broad collumn categories: stereotypical, traditionally male roles, controverisal roles, etc..
-unlock stories
	-requirement -> stories after ending -> unlock!!
	-e.g. being a wise grandma made you understand how much worse your life could have been -> unlocks child labourer
	-e.g. doing well as a sexy teenager at 16 and a wise grandma made you understand the true nature of sex and age -> grandma porn star
	-spending so much time at the computer as an engineer revealed that you could be a professional video gamer -> unlockes video gamer
	-sharing your life experience with your friends made you realize the power of technology -> unlocks engineer
	-some cheeky story about how you unlock the skip command :).
	-some cheeky story about how you unlock challenge mode
	-etc.
-challenge mode 
	-lets you choose characters/difficulties and perform for character specific high score!!!



::INDIECADE FEEDBACK::
-most people lose princess on first try
-young girls getting very excited
-at least one person not understanding choosing
-only younger girls went for minister and fundraiser
-john romero barely looked at our game :)
-people read/laugh out loud at writing :)
-more than one woman said "glad this game is made"
-everyone goes for angry woman hehe...
-lots of family's playing the game.
-almost no one chose sexy
-people (possibly ironically) comment on how the text is judging them
-in general players do have reactions to bad performance
-there was one boy who tried to restart the game on the laptop (and crashed it) and then played the game for only one age not doing so well (went for gang leader) and wos totally unwilling to make the full poses. A little girl was watching and was super excited to play after him and then convinced a really nice lady playng afterwards to go for all the hard choices causing her to lose :).

-use more forgiving grading for festival version???
-beach mom I've only seen as "easy"
-angry age 60 almost always hard/xtreme
-shoulder over hair on belly dance teacher
-xtream minister can be beat without doing too much
-some connections make more sense than others...
-some people still don't get the color/difficulty thing.
-kinect overheating?? the old one would randomly crash after a while... happened once on the new kinect too but never again, artifact??
-all extreme at age 65 is possible and quite frequent. I like this from a gameplay perspective but not necessarily from a conceptual standpoint.
-prayer xtreme is beatable on first try...

(Particle effects to old lady are added.)

DONE-skeleton is different, figure out what skeleton information is good!!
DONE/OK-make sure all information can be obtained from openNI on OSX
		DONE-hand position is good but I guess not rotation?? (not that I care)
		DONE-need to use left/rightKnee rotation and not position of foot
-figure out why it takes so long to load on OSX, does it take this long on windows??
	DONE/a little slower but still not as slow-try running on windows using openni+NITE
-why is Nearest Neighbor scaling not NN	

	
::NEW ZIG MANAGER NONSENSE::
-POSE current and POSE target to do interpolation
-POSE target updated via whatever
	-this means either using positions or angles as before
-if you can't get waist in openNI, need to disable it in pose rendering and grading
IGNORE, only happens in ProjectionManager contained mess...-remove get_relative and instead hardcode relative joint information and just do get_angle(ZigJointId)
DONE-need definitive function to determine openNI or Kinect and use different algorithms in each case
	-function to detect what SDK is being used, this needs to look for zig input container after startup and read which sdk is being used... pfft


::TODO::
:other:

	-finally, automatically make me an asset bundle :)
	-but I guess if you can't do that then you'll want to use a python script of sorts
DONE-new file naming scheme
	-Assets/PRECHAR/<character number>/ (where character number is as before, e.g. 05-1)
	-AUDIO.mp3 for audio
	-character files as before, but no longer in CHARACTERS folder
	-background files should be as follows
		-BACKGROUND.png for background
		-BG-1.png, BG-2.png, ... for BG elements
		-FG-1.png, ... for FG elements
		-POSITIONS.png for positions
		
		
::TODO::
